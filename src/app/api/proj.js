    description: "Air-purifying respirators are used for high threat environments in the military. The respirators are designed with rubber surfaces creating a seal around the face or neck of the wearer. The downside is that the rubber seals are uncomfortable for the wearer, negatively impacting task performance. To combat this issue, loose-fitting Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) exist, which use pressure from an electric air blower to protect the wearer without rubber seals. We propose the development of a novel pressuring method for a PAPR device. In this method, electrohydrodynamic (EHD) phenomena are leveraged to create a smaller, lighter air blower unit which does not contain any moving parts. The unit is comfortable to wear, lightweight, small, and quiet. It is capable of withstanding chemicals, biological agents, and extreme weather conditions."

  { project: "Dwenguino", leaders: ["Heran Wang"], id: "2", description: "Electronic boards for ubiquitous computing, such as Dwenguino and Arduino, operate increasingly in environments with frequencies that exceed the standard MIL 461. Many military contracts require compliance with MIL-STD-461E. The latest revision (as of 2015) is known as \"MIL-STD-461G.\" The electromagnetic interference analysis requirements for this standard stipulates the need for radiated emissions testing requirements to the frequency of 18 GHz. However, many boards must perform at higher frequencies, corresponding to the conducting emissions requirements going up to 50 GHz. The boards are not tested to such high frequencies for radiated emissions, and, more importantly, the methodologies for predicting their performance are not well developed." },
